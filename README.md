A project demonstrating the use of [FOSSA](https://fossa.com/) to regenerate [FFXVI's OSS license file](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/upOlWzI2jlQ). This is the side quest we've all been waiting for!

## Prerequisites

 - [ ] Engage in the playing of the FFXVI soundtrack, [at this designated location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58lNeY2Gpqk&list=PLFHRxdgR3MH8JOUcavLuNgfCTzkXCjUQQ&index=3); this repository shall duly furnish it for your enjoyment.
 - [ ] The FOSSA CLI eluded discovery at Charon's Toll; nevertheless, indications suggest its possible presence [here](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). Procure it.
 - [ ] Industrious and zealous Blackthorne is unable to contrive FOSSA API tokens. However, he possesses knowledge that the preeminent FOSSA API token can be forged within the precincts of the FOSSA UI, referencing this [artefact](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token) he happened upon.
 - [ ] Replicate this repository employing Phoenix capabilities.

## "Why, the beast has the appetite of a behemouth!" â€• Harpocrates ðŸ˜œ

Behold, presented herein is a [public report](https://app.fossa.com/reports/cf26a84d-fd9a-41ed-8f7f-1728a97b92e3), meticulously generated by the auspices of FOSSA. Though not an exact correspondence to FFXVI's license file, it does unveil certain among the discovered licenses associated with these software packages, and beyond. By way of example, within the license file of FFXVI, the obligations to the `HarfBuzz` package stipulate, "For parts of HarfBuzz that are licensed under different licenses see individual filenames COPYING in subdirectories where applicable." Both the FOSSA user interface and the aforestated report reveal such intricacies; typically overseen by Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), legal practitioners of Open Source Software (OSS), or external counsel, this data is commonly processed to gain further clarity regarding the usage of the software packages. In its entirety, FOSSA adeptly discerned the licenses applicable to each software package, subsequently presenting them within a commendatory dossier. These two forms of reports offer an array of resemblances and disparities. Please feel unreservedly welcome to inaugurate a GitHub Issue to foster supplementary discourse upon this matter.
