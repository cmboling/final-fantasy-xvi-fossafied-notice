A project demonstrating the use of [FOSSA](https://fossa.com/) to regenerate FFXVI's OSS attributions. This is the side quest we've all been waiting for!

## Prerequisites

 - [ ] Engage in the playing of the FFXVI soundtrack, [at this designated location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58lNeY2Gpqk&list=PLFHRxdgR3MH8JOUcavLuNgfCTzkXCjUQQ&index=3); this repository shall duly furnish it for your enjoyment.
 - [ ] The FOSSA CLI eluded discovery at Charon's Toll; nevertheless, indications suggest its possible presence [here](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli). Procure it.
 - [ ] Industrious and zealous Blackthorne is unable to contrive FOSSA API tokens. However, he possesses knowledge that the preeminent FOSSA API token can be forged within the precincts of the FOSSA UI, referencing this [artefact](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/api-reference#push-only-api-token) he happened upon.
 - [ ] Replicate this repository employing Phoenix capabilities.
 

 ## Come To Me, Ifrit!
 
 In unison with your retinue, equip your token and employ the command `fossa analyze` amidst the throes of epic battle.

## My wounds, Torgal!

- Ensure that the analysis is conducted at the foundation of this repository.
- Verify that your API token has been established.
- Should you encounter persistent difficulties, do not hesitate to consult the Founder!
